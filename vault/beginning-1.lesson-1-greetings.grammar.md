## G1.1: Equational Expressions
> (Noun$_1$은/는) Noun$_2$이에요/예요. (N$_1$$=$N$_2$)  
> (Noun$_1$은/는) Noun$_2$(이/가) 아니에요. (N$_1$$\neq$N$_2$)

Topic-Comment structure is one of the fundamental ways of conveying ideas. It is usually in this form:

Topic person, idea, object + Comment to describe topic

In this context, we look at **noun equivalency**. Note that if the following sentences refer to the same topic, we don't have to redefine topic, eg:
- $N_1 = N_2$
- $\dots = N_3 \leftarrow N_1=N_3 \textrm{, carries over}$

### Case 1: $N_1 = N_2$



### Case 2: $N_1 \neq N_2$


## G1.2: Omission of redundant elements

## G1.3: Comparing items: 은/는 vs. 도

## G1.4: Yes-or-no questions
> A: N이에요/예요?  
> B: 네/이니오, N이에요/예요.
